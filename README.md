# Creature Sim Frontend

React frontend for Creature Sim Project

## Setup / Running Locally

### Setup

- Install Node
- npm install

#### Useful VS Code Notes

_These notes on VS code setup are mainly for my own reference..._

Install Extensions:

- ESLint
- npm
- npm intellisense
- Prettier

Set save to "onFocusChange".

Install Font `Fira Code`, add to VS code and enable ligatures.

### Running Locally

- npm run dev

This will run the front end in dev mode, you'll also need to have the API running to use the app properly.
